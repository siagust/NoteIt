## NoteIt expense tracker app: Privacy policy

Welcome to the NoteIt app for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by Agus. The source code is available on GitHub; the
app is also available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps
collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app
preferences (like theme, etc.)) created by the you is stored on your device only, and can be simply
erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any
question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try
to fix it/help you.
